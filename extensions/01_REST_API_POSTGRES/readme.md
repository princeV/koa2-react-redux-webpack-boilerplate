# Extension 01 - REST API Postgres

This is the first extension that includes a REST API at the backend with a connection to a postgres db.

__Note:__  
This is only very basic functionality without any intent to serve as a "real world" boilerplate.

What's __not__ included:
- User management
- Any kind of authentication
- API test
- Production setup
